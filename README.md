The goal of this work is to calculate the non-perturbative solution contribution due to instantons for Yang-Mills theory via path integral method. In particular, we are interested in the $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry case, as we can compare our result with the prediction of Seiberg-Witten theory on instanton effect.\\


We starts by introducing instanton as solution of  $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory after imposing the self-duality condition. Since Yang-Mills action is a second order partial differential equation, imposing self duality constraints allow us to solve the action via first order differential equations. \\

Next, we construct the instanton moduli space by first using zero-modes and collective coordinates, then we introduce ADHM construction for building the moduli space in the general scenarios. We also add a discussion about ADHM construction in string theory setting. \\

Then, we write the $\mathcal{N} = 1,2$ supersymmetric zero-modes explicitly. After that we suggest a BRST algebra from studying the zero-modes. Combining with topological twisting of $\mathcal{N} =  2$ SUSY theory in flat space, we  rewrite the multi-instanton action in BRST-close form.\\

After that we try to mitigate the small instanton singularity and non-compactness of the instanton moduli space. We introduce non-commutative space to regularize the moduli space. And we utilize localization to deal with the non-compactness of the moduli space. However, the critical points of the action are not isolated at this stage, and we have to further deform the moduli space by a $T^2$-rotation for localization to work properly. \\

Finally, we conclude the work by calculating the prepotential of one and two instantons explicitly using the method we derived. And we compare the result with the one predicted by Seiberg-Witten theory.
